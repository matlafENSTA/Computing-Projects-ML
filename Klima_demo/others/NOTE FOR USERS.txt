Information about the process can be found in the following files :
- PINE_tutorial.pdf to calibrate the model for the studied catchment and learn how to use PINE
- Klima folder structure.pdf to understand the purpose of every folder located in Klima
- Klima programs execution.pdf to follow the PINE routine and have an overlook on the timeline of data processing

If you find some times, there are still some improvements to implement in the scripts. Here is a non-exhaustive list :

climate_models_RCP_sfVersion.R : 
	- do not compute the historical values for every scenario maybe ? Would save a few hours.
Plotting.R :
	- warning issues (working but annoying and maybe data badly processed)
csv_to_txt_Sildre_SeNorge.py : 
	- the function extract_data_from_csv should sum the precipitation data day by day instead of computing the average! (it is not a problem
	  as long as we download daily data and not hourly data for precipitation) so temperature, discharge and precipitation shouldnt be treated
	  the same way.
	- define an extreme value for every variable (and maybe two, min and max ?)
	- side quest : check units, convert automatically it if not correct (maybe not worth the effort)
pine_files_creation.py :
	- handle the problem of warnings (the script tries to create too many setup files and thinks that there are missing data while there isn't).
	- modify the date and hour of creation in update_setuphps()
	- add further information in the recapfile created
climate_models_RCP_to_BiasCorrect.py :
	- implement a way to find the nearest geographical point without searching manually in Grid_nodesD.txt pointing the place on this map : 
	  https://norgeskart.no/ (use cartesian norm for coordinates and find the minimal distance ?) : find_geopoint() python function.
	- side quest : use identifiers for precip and temp instead of if/else
